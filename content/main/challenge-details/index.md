## Why?

Over the past decade, the gap between the IT Industry and academia was discussed on various platforms, yet neither the syllabus, nor the hiring process changed. #TeamTanayJobChallenge is an initiative where students or potential employees work on real life projects, along with mentors. And the mentors will give shoutouts and reviews to students they have mentored.

## What?

\#TeamTanayJobChallenge requires you to finish a minimum of 5 projects, 3 blogs and 2 reviews on your projects. The first 5 to do so will get a shout-out for job/ internship by mentors and community leaders.

## How?

To participate all you have to do is

1.  Make projects
1.  Put the code on GitHub publicly
1.  Host the projects on Netlify or now.sh or any other tool of your choice.
1.  Create a portfolio to showcase your journey, projects and blogs
