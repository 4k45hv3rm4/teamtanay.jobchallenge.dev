Hi! I am Soham. Let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs. ðŸ™‚

### Introduction

I am kind of an introvert. I like to express my thoughts through computers.
I started programming because I thought it was elegant! ðŸ¤“

## Why are you taking this challenge?

After 10th Boards, I wanted to get an internship.
I want to learn and grow as a developer.

## Something interesting about you?

I love to play Minecraft and am pretty good at building (in the game ðŸ˜…).

### Help I need?

I would like help in designing mobile views for websites.
I can do it, just not very good at it.
