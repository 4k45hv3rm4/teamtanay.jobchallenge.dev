> Hi! I am a Mustafa Saifee, let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs.

------

### introduction

I am a very community person. I like to network with *real* people. LinkedIn is where I am most active at. I enjoy DevOps and Cloud Computing stuff because I find it very easy to grasp. Simple

------

## why are you taking this challenge?

- Learn -> Become the Best -> Mentor -> Learn
- I need an internship in July 2020.
- I wish to solve problems that would sound impossible in general, and then become a *superhero* by solving it .

------

## something interesting about you?

I have mentored 1500+ students to get started with *Cloud Computing*. I am just too crazy about the developments revolving around cloud technologies.

------

### help I need?

- Get hired to actual learn how it's done in the live environment
- To be the best biggest opensource contributor in the country(and I am completely noob at opensource contribution as I lack a starting point)
- Work at Microsoft

### projects

My projects:

#### Engine Efficiency

_description_ : A project for mechanical engineering students to simplify their calculations for finding the efficiency of their engine by just putting in some values.

_stack_ Made in Java with NetBeans

_hosted link_ : Unable to locate the project files. Also I never imagined that it would be useful to show as a project in future as I was not aware of its importance. Recently learned GitHub so that I can record my future projects on Git.

#### Authentication for Female specific apps

_description_ : A project for apps that are supposed to be used only by women. Before any screen or any activity, the app will first prompt for a face scan. And if the app determines that its a female, only then it will let the user register for the app. Second layer of authentication included data fetching from Aadhar

_stack_ : Made on Android Platform using Java. Use of Computer Vision API key for gender detection.
