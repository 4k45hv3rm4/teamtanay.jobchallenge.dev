### introduction

I am an IT engineering student studying in Sixth semester. I never had much interest in coding. But now I have started to have some. Thus I am learning develpment now, with my interest in it. 

## why are you taking this challenge?

I need an internship|job in December 2020.
I want to learn.

## something interesting about you?

I know lyrics to almost all Bollywood songs,yes I do. 
I write poetry in Hindi. 
I can walk really long distances. I remember, last time I walked continuously(with tiny breaks) was around 12 km. (This one is weird, I know. :))

### help I need?

I have just started as I mentioned earlier. So, I will need help at every step. I will first try to look for resources by myself. If I am unable to find some, I will seek for guidance.
