Hi! I am pursuing 3rd year of computer science engineering and would like to take up this challenge for expanding my knowledge and career.

### introduction

I am studious but I need guidance. With proper guidance I can do anything as there'd never be any hesitation of any sort from my side in terms of putting in the work.

## why are you taking this challenge?

I am willing to work as an intern to observe the work environment and learn how to work in a firm.
I want to be strong in my domain.

## something interesting about you?
