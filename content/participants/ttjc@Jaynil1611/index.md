### projects

I have done some projects in the past but I haven't really hosted them all. I will update with the hosting as soon as possible.
I will also update with current projects done during the challenge.

My past projects:

#### BFS vs A*: Which is better? 

_description_ When you talk about the comparison between various algorithms in terms of programming, it also essential to actually visualize and see the actual difference between those algorithms. I have made a project which makes a comparison between Breadth First Search (BFS) and A* star algorithm to compute the shortest path between given source and destination with obstacles in their way.

_stack_ The project involved a major component of Java and Canvas library in Java for the graphical user interface(GUI).
