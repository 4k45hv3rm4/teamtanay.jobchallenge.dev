# Hi! I am Rajat.

### Introduction

I am a final year Computer Science Undergraduate and an aspiring Software Developer working in Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, HCI and UX Design. I am a Google Scholarship Alumni, have worked in 3 companies as a Software Development Intern, was one of the top 5 mentors in Girlscript Summer of Code 2018, and an active member of the Google Developers Group Kolkata community. I have participated in 5 hackathons and have been in the top 10 in 3 of them. I am also one of the 4 Google Scholorship Alumnis who was provided with a fully sponsored trip to attend Google I/O 2019, the annual Developer Conference organized by Google at MountainView, California.

## Why are you taking this challenge?

I am taking this challenge in the hope of getting job opportunities in the space that I am interested in i.e AR/VR, UX Design and Mobile Development. As a Software Developer I am constantly trying to improve upon my skills, specifically in writing production level code. I am looking for a company where I can pair up with a senior engineer in order to learn and practice how to write production level code for some impactful product. I am willing to dedicate years of practice into perfecting the craft of writing production level code.

## Something interesting about you?

 - **Avid reader** - I developed the habit of reading in my quest to understand how people think and work. It's fascinating how much you can learn from the experiences of someone's life. I enjoy reading and didn't count the number of books that I have read before 2020, but I am tracking the count this year **_(8 read and applied, 34 more to go)_**. 
 - **Speedcuber** - Solved the 3X3 (sub 30), 4X4, 5x5, Mirror Cube and the Megaminx. 
 - **Sparrow lover** - Clicks and collects snaps of sparrows. I can stare at these adorable creatures for hours! 
 - **Foodie** - A voracious one. 

### Help I need?

It would be good if someone tells me which role will be suitable for me and also recommend me for the sameðŸ˜Š. [Here is my resume.](https://bit.ly/knightcube-resume)

**_I love "coding" but not only "coding"_**. I love brainstorming ideas, explaining concepts through flowcharts and design, planning how to design a Software that scales and then begin coding. I believe technical and non technical products are both equally required to create a sustainable ecosystem and add value to people's lives. I have studied UX Design principles in depth from [Interaction Design Foundation](www.interaction-design.org/rajat-kumar-gupta) and want to apply them in conjunction with the products that I develop(in AR/VR domain).

### Projects
Projects in my internships were confidential and the codebase cannot be shared but those were the most valuable projects that I worked on and I can talk about them in detail only with a recruiter.

I made a compilation of all the AR Prototypes that I developed in 2019 ðŸ‘‡

#### Augmented Gardens

**Description**: In luxurious hotels and residential housing complexes, the creative minds that go behind designing the garden and lawns often face trouble when communicating their thoughts to clients through their 2D designs. We developed a mobile application, with Augmented Reality capabilities, using which the designer can show the client exactly what the garden looks like and customize it quickly with the feedback he or she gets.

The application has a separate segment(AR mode) that provides a bunch of 3D virtual models of various plants, flowers and decor stuff that can be placed in the real world with real-time scaling, rotating and moving around the models around in the user's real environment.

The application hence prevents communication gaps between the client and the garden designer (or design agencies). 
Running more design iterations on this product should fetch the designing agency happy clients, which are of course important for running any business and developing useful products. 

**Stack**: Unity, Augmented Reality, UX Design
